					<p>Below 3.2 kg - only slightly below average - <strong>a child's birth-weight correlates</strong> with the mother's nutrient deficits by some:    </p>

				
						<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20% - key minerals &amp; vitamins, <a href="#references">[19]</a>
						<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50% - omega-3 DHA <a href="#references">[19,20]</a>
						<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70% - ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 oils (since omega-6  competes with omega-3 for enzyme use).
			
						<p><strong>Note</strong>: The wide range of theses nutrients trialed and advised is tabled &amp; referenced shortly before the main References.</p>
			
						<p><strong>The source of omega-3 DHA is mainly fish</strong>, long associated with brain quality, since 1972 shown scientifically. <a href="#references">[21]</a> </p>
		
						<p><strong>The mother's build-up of micro-nutrient</strong> stores for crucial stages, such as the neural tube's sealing at 3 weeks; or major call for DHA in the brain's rapid growth spurt in the third trimester, is high priority. DHA shortage will prejudice the baby's brain and deplete the mother’s brain, rendering her liable to depression.</p>
		
						<p><strong>Deprivation's worst and lasting effects</strong> on the fetus are due to poor maternal nutrition, and increased stress, with high maternal-fetal cortisol. <a href="#references">[41]</a> Stress and its effects are reduced by caring family, friends, and professional support, Comfort reduces  cortisol, increasing endorphins and other hormones favouring development.</p>
			
						<p>All negative factors play a part in the Cycle of Deprivation, repeating each generation. Badly deprived areas have many more low birthweight babies than better off areas, eg UK <a href="#references">[42]</a> or Berlin <a href="#references">[61]</a></p>
				
						<p><strong>Twins, low birthweight and IVF</strong>.</p>
			
						<p>With twins: low birthweight is 10 times as likely to occur; preterm 9 times as likely, infant death 5 times; cerebral palsy 4 times, neonatal costs are on average 16 times average. Of 20 twin pairs in the UK, 13 to 19 have been from IVF. </p>
			
						<p class="collapse" style="line-height: 8;">&nbsp;</p>
			
						<p><strong>IVF is used most wisely and effectively</strong> in the tenth of cases when preconception care has not been enough to allow conception. Preconception care saves hassle, risk, and high cost and it has been shown to double the chance of IVF success,<a href="#references">[27]</a> with a strong record of achieving fully healthy children. IVF is important in specific cases such as a blocked fallopian tube. </p>

					<br><strong>"Fish is good for the brain"</strong> - an age-old saying but in 1972 <strong>Professor Michael Crawford</strong> showed us the molecule that matters most - <strong>omega-3 DHA</strong> - short for docosahexaenoic acid.
					<br>DHA, a chain of 22 carbon atoms, has 6 double-bonds  giving it unique electronic and photo-electric properties. The landmark research won Michael Crawford the Alexander Leaf Award. DHA, in the oceans' algae and seaweeds for 2 billion years, is essential to cell membranes, and now especially to brain and retina.
